### Whew
A few youtube videos and docs later, I finally have a new theme for my site that works pretty well.

I have a few things I want to try to, like being able to add to my blog from my phone and adding catergories for my post, but that'll come later.

For now, I'll just keep track of my categories using the header and a seperate file before I add a page for it later down the line, but overall, I'm happy with this for now! 

I have some projects I plan on tackling this year but I wanted to get this blog fully up and running before I officially started anything, I still want to create a blog for my team, Sinister Script, and our CTF progress throughout the year, but I'll finish up that next week before we participate in another competition.
